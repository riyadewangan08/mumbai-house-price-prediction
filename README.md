## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### ▶️ Missing Values Heatmap  
Shows which columns contain null values.  
📌 *Used to decide what to drop/fill.*

## 📊 Feature Engineering & Encoding

- Used **`get_dummies()`** for categorical data  
- Filled selected null values using `mean()` or `mode()`  
- Dropped outliers and high-missing-value columns
- Encoded final dataset for model training

---

## 🧠 Models Applied

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Lasso Regression**
3. **Random Forest Regression**

Each model was trained and evaluated on the same split data.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Metrics used:
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score (Goodness of fit)

| Model             | R² Score | RMSE       |
|------------------|----------|------------|
| Linear Regression| 0.82     | ₹19.18 Lakh|
| Lasso Regression | 0.82     | ₹19.18 Lakh|
| Random Forest    | 0.77     | ₹21.89 Lakh|

## 👩‍💻 Tools Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Joblib (for model export)


## Business Insights
📍 Location, Area, and Number of Bedrooms play the most crucial role in predicting prices.

🧠 Random Forest provides feature importance, even if its accuracy is slightly lower.

🔁 Linear and Lasso performed equally with higher R² values.

📈 Residuals indicate the model fits well (errors are normally distributed).

🔍 EDA helped in detecting outliers and missing trends


## 📃 Conclusion
✅ This project reflects a full ML pipeline for regression analysis.

✅ Performed complete data cleaning, visualization, modeling, and evaluation.

📌 Can be extended with more features like nearby amenities, age of property, etc.

📦 Model saved using joblib for deployment.
